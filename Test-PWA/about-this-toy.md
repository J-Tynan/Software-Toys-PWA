# Test PWA

This toy is a minimal test harness used to verify that `Architecture.md` and `CONTRACTS.md` expectations are met. It provides a header, sticky settings panel, blank canvas, and a two-row footer with test controls and status.

Use this toy for smoke tests and development verification only.
