### What is a fractal

Fractals are patterns that repeat at different scales. They are generated by applying a simple mathematical rule repeatedly; the result often shows self-similarity (parts resemble the whole) and complex, detailed structure as you zoom in. Fractals appear in nature (coastlines, clouds, plants) and are used in computer graphics, modelling, and the study of chaotic systems.



### How this toy helps

* Explore classic fractals (Mandelbrot, Julia, Burning Ship) interactively.
* Discover structure by zooming and panning without losing context.
* Experiment with iteration depth and colour to see how rendering choices affect detail and performance.
